# Bayesian-based-Nonlocal-Means-Filtering
Optimized bayesian nonlocal-means algorithm for denoising ultrasound image

# Descriptions
* BayesianNLM.m : the OBNLM algorithm
* getPearsonDistance.m: compute the pearson distance based bayesian framework
* ImgNormalize.m: pre-processing the image (histogram stretching)
* testBayesianNLM.m: test our algorithm using the input (Noise/noisyImage.png) and get the output (despeckledImage.png)
